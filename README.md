# Student Feedback Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze student feedback from an existing dataset and display the results in an admin portal.
The goal is to improve the educational experience by providing actionable insights to administrators and educators.

## Overview

Our project consists of two main components:

1. **Data Analysis Engine**: This component processes the existing dataset containing student feedback.
   It performs cleaning, pre-processing, and analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights such as common themes, sentiments, overall scores, and trends.

2. **Admin Portal**: Administrators can log in to the admin portal to view dashboards that provide a comprehensiveoverview of the analyzed student feedback.
   The portal presents the insights in a user-friendly manner using various visualization techniques such as bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds.

## Tech Stack

1. **Design**: The design of the application was done using Figma, a collaborative interface design tool.

2. **Frontend**: HTML and CSS were used to create the frontend pages of the application.
   
3. **Authentication Portal**: The authentication portal was built using ReactJS for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

4. **Backend**: Node.js was used for the backend of the application.
   
5. **Data Analysis**: Afinn and SVM (Support Vector Machine) were used for analyzing textual feedback from students.
   
6. **Testing**: Selenium was used for testing the application.

## Benefits

1. **Streamlined Analysis**: The system streamlines the process of analyzing large datasets of student feedback.

2. **Actionable Insights**: Detailed insights help administrators make informed decisions to enhance the quality of education.

3. **Data-driven Decisions**: By leveraging student feedback, institutions can make data-driven decisions to address issues and enhance learning outcomes.
